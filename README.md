# Mock store - products table component

Mock store api built as a technical task as part of the interview process for a role.
Guidelines were to use React + Material UI and spend 1-2 hours. I decided to keep within these guidelines as I wanted to showcase what was achievable in the smaller timeframe.

With more time, I would look to add caching, tweak the UI to collapse/expand the description, add a mock basket, fit the images a bit more sensibly, and customise the Material UI based on some brand guidelines.

I am in the process of writing a couple of basic tests, yet to be added to the repo.
